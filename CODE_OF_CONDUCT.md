# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, and we mean *everyone*. This is a community for solving technical problems, not political problems. We understand that a common tactic is to claim that a political agenda transcends politics. It does not. It is not welcome. If you cannot accept that, then you are not welcome.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, political opinions, oversharing, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is explicitly representing the project. There is no "community." People who participate in this project are not expected to share values, cultures, political opinions, or goals. This code in no way infringes upon your behavior outside of direct engagement with the project.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.
